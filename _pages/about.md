I am Ashwani Kumar. Currently I work as a senior computational biologist at McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, UTSW, Dallas, TX. I earned my bachelor in Bioinformatics from VIT University, India in 2010. To pursue my graduate studies, I joined Department of Microbiology at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio in 2012. I then joined UTSW as a computational biologist in July of 2015.
I received my training in biology, computer science and statistics. Currently, I work at the intersection of next generation sequenicng technologies and different branches of life science(such as genetics. microbiology, cancer, immunology). I have dealt with huge amount of sequenicng data ranging from microarray, RNA sequencing, whole genome sequencing, metagenomics, crispr to single cell and spatial.

A normal day of me working in lab would look like, trying to leverage sequencing data to make new discoveries. With the dramatic increase in computation hardware, computing and statistical methods in AI and ML, I truely believe that these can be used to provide better insights about biological questions such as disease marker, faster discoveries of drug candidate, better management of future events in public health. However one of the challanges is to ensure better quality of data with more signal than noise. For a list of my research publication, please visit "My publication" tab.
